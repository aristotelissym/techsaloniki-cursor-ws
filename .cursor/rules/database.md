# Database Rules (MySQL)

- Use `snake_case` for table and column names.
- Use UUIDs for primary keys.
- Define explicit types for each field (e.g., VARCHAR(255), ENUM, INT).
- Use `NOT NULL` where applicable to enforce required data.
- Use ENUMs for fixed choices like `sex` and `cat_dog_lover`.
- Use InnoDB as the storage engine and utf8mb4 as the character set.
