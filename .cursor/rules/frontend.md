# Frontend Rules (Next.js + TailwindCSS)

- Use functional React components only.
- Use Tailwind utility classes for all styling â€” no custom CSS unless necessary.
- Place page components in the `pages/` directory.
- Place reusable UI elements in `components/`.
- Use hooks for state and side effects.
- Validate all form inputs before submission.
- Use toasts or alerts for user feedback on CRUD actions.
