# General Rules

- Use TypeScript syntax throughout the project.
- Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary.
- Always use async/await for asynchronous operations.
- Handle errors gracefully at all levels.
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/classes).
