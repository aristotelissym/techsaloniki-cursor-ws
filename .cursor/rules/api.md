# API Rules (REST)

- Use standard RESTful routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Each endpoint should perform a single responsibility.
- Use consistent route naming: `/members`, `/members/:id`.
- Validate all request bodies and query parameters.
- Return data in JSON format, with a consistent structure.
- Include appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200, 201, 400, 404, 500).
